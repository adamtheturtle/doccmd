Usage: main [OPTIONS] [FILE_PATHS]...

  Run commands against code blocks in the given documentation files.

  This works with Markdown and reStructuredText files.

Options:
  -l, --language TEXT           Run `command` against code blocks for this
                                language.  [required]
  -c, --command TEXT            [required]
  --file-suffix TEXT            The file extension to give to the temporary file
                                made from the code block. By default, the file
                                extension is inferred from the language, or it
                                is '.txt' if the language is not recognized.
  --file-secondary-suffix TEXT  The 'secondary suffix' to give to the temporary
                                file made from the code block. With the default
                                value '.doccmd', the temporary file will have a
                                name which ends with, e.g. '.doccmd.py' for
                                Python code blocks.  [default: .doccmd;
                                required]
  --pad-file / --no-pad-file    Run the command against a temporary file padded
                                with newlines. This is useful for matching line
                                numbers from the output to the relevant location
                                in the document. Use --no-pad-file for
                                formatters - they generally need to look at the
                                file without padding.  [default: pad-file]
  --version                     Show the version and exit.
  -v, --verbose                 Enable verbose output.
  --help                        Show this message and exit.
