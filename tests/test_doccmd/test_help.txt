Usage: doccmd [OPTIONS] [DOCUMENT_PATHS]...

  Run commands against code blocks in the given documentation files.

  This works with reStructuredText, MyST, Markdown, MDX, and Djot files.

Required options:
  -c, --command TEXT              The command to run against code blocks.
                                  [required]

Code block selection:
  -l, --language TEXT             Run `command` against code blocks for this
                                  language. Give multiple times for multiple
                                  languages. If this is not given, no code
                                  blocks are run, unless `--sphinx-jinja2` is
                                  given.
  --skip-marker TEXT              The marker used to identify code blocks to be
                                  skipped.
                                  
                                  By default, code blocks which come just after
                                  a comment matching 'skip doccmd[all]: next'
                                  are skipped (e.g. `.. skip doccmd[all]: next`
                                  in reStructuredText, `<!--- skip doccmd[all]:
                                  next -->` in Markdown or MDX, or `% skip
                                  doccmd[all]: next` in MyST).
                                  
                                  When using this option, those, and code blocks
                                  which come just after a comment including the
                                  given marker are ignored. For example, if the
                                  given marker is 'type-check', code blocks
                                  which come just after a comment matching 'skip
                                  doccmd[type-check]: next' are also skipped.
                                  
                                  To skip a code block for each of multiple
                                  markers, for example to skip a code block for
                                  the ``type-check`` and ``lint`` markers but
                                  not all markers, add multiple ``skip doccmd``
                                  comments above the code block.
  --sphinx-jinja2 / --no-sphinx-jinja2
                                  Whether to parse `sphinx-jinja2` blocks. This
                                  is useful for evaluating code blocks with
                                  Jinja2 templates used in Sphinx documentation.
                                  This is supported for MyST and
                                  reStructuredText files only.  [default: no-
                                  sphinx-jinja2]

Grouping options:
  --group-marker TEXT             The marker used to identify code blocks to be
                                  grouped.
                                  
                                  By default, code blocks which come just
                                  between comments matching 'group doccmd[all]:
                                  start' and 'group doccmd[all]: end' are
                                  grouped (e.g. `.. group doccmd[all]: start` in
                                  reStructuredText, `<!--- group doccmd[all]:
                                  start -->` in Markdown/MDX, or `% group
                                  doccmd[all]: start` in MyST).
                                  
                                  When using this option, those, and code blocks
                                  which are grouped by a comment including the
                                  given marker are ignored. For example, if the
                                  given marker is 'type-check', code blocks
                                  which come within comments matching 'group
                                  doccmd[type-check]: start' and 'group
                                  doccmd[type-check]: end' are also skipped.
                                  
                                  Error messages for grouped code blocks may
                                  include lines which do not match the document,
                                  so code formatters will not work on them.
  --group-file / --no-group-file  Automatically group all code blocks within
                                  each file. When enabled, all code blocks in a
                                  file are treated as a single group and
                                  executed together, without requiring explicit
                                  group directives. This is useful for files
                                  where code blocks are designed for sequential
                                  execution. Error messages for grouped code
                                  blocks may include lines which do not match
                                  the document, so code formatters will not work
                                  on them.  [default: no-group-file]
  --pad-groups / --no-pad-groups  Maintain line spacing between groups from the
                                  source file in the temporary file. This is
                                  useful for matching line numbers from the
                                  output to the relevant location in the
                                  document. Use --no-pad-groups for formatters -
                                  they generally need to look at the file
                                  without padding.  [default: pad-groups]
  --fail-on-group-write / --no-fail-on-group-write
                                  Whether to fail (with exit code 1) if a
                                  command (e.g. a formatter) tries to change
                                  code within a grouped code block. ``doccmd``
                                  does not support writing to grouped code
                                  blocks.  [default: fail-on-group-write]
  --group-mdx-by-attribute TEXT   Group MDX code blocks by the value of the
                                  specified attribute. Code blocks with the same
                                  attribute value are grouped together and
                                  executed as a single unit. For example, with
                                  `--group-mdx-by-attribute group`, code blocks
                                  with `group="example1"` are grouped together.
                                  This follows the Docusaurus convention for
                                  grouping code blocks. This option only applies
                                  to MDX files. Error messages for grouped code
                                  blocks may include lines which do not match
                                  the document, so code formatters will not work
                                  on them.

Temporary file options:
  --temporary-file-extension TEXT
                                  The file extension to give to the temporary
                                  file made from the code block. By default, the
                                  file extension is inferred from the language,
                                  or it is '.txt' if the language is not
                                  recognized.
  --temporary-file-name-prefix TEXT
                                  The prefix to give to the temporary file made
                                  from the code block. This is useful for
                                  distinguishing files created by this tool from
                                  other files, e.g. for ignoring in linter
                                  configurations.  [default: doccmd; required]
  --temporary-file-name-template TEXT
                                  The template for the temporary file name.
                                  Available placeholders: {prefix} (from
                                  --temporary-file-name-prefix), {source}
                                  (sanitized source filename), {line} (line
                                  number), {unique} (unique identifier),
                                  {suffix} (file extension, required). Example:
                                  '{prefix}_{unique}{suffix}' produces
                                  'doccmd_a1b2.py'.  [default:
                                  {prefix}_{source}_l{line}__{unique}_{suffix};
                                  required]
  --pad-file / --no-pad-file      Run the command against a temporary file
                                  padded with newlines. This is useful for
                                  matching line numbers from the output to the
                                  relevant location in the document. Use --no-
                                  pad-file for formatters - they generally need
                                  to look at the file without padding.
                                  [default: pad-file]
  --write-to-file / --no-write-to-file
                                  Write any changes made by the command back to
                                  the source document. Grouped code blocks never
                                  write to files.  [default: write-to-file]

File discovery options:
  --rst-extension TEXT            Treat files with this extension (suffix) as
                                  reStructuredText. Give this multiple times to
                                  look for multiple extensions. To avoid
                                  considering any files, including the default,
                                  as reStructuredText files, use `--rst-
                                  extension=.`.  [default: .rst]
  --myst-extension TEXT           Treat files with this extension (suffix) as
                                  MyST. Give this multiple times to look for
                                  multiple extensions. To avoid considering any
                                  files, including the default, as MyST files,
                                  use `--myst-extension=.`.  [default: .md]
  --markdown-extension TEXT       Files with this extension (suffix) to treat as
                                  Markdown. Give this multiple times to look for
                                  multiple extensions. By default, `.md` is
                                  treated as MyST, not Markdown. Use `--mdx-
                                  extension` for MDX files.
  --mdx-extension TEXT            Treat files with this extension (suffix) as
                                  MDX. Give this multiple times to look for
                                  multiple extensions.  [default: .mdx]
  --djot-extension TEXT           Treat files with this extension (suffix) as
                                  Djot. Give this multiple times to look for
                                  multiple extensions.  [default: .djot]
  --norg-extension TEXT           Treat files with this extension (suffix) as
                                  Norg. Give this multiple times to look for
                                  multiple extensions.  [default: .norg]
  --max-depth INTEGER RANGE       Maximum depth to search for files in
                                  directories.  [x>=1]
  --exclude TEXT                  A glob-style pattern that matches file paths
                                  to ignore while recursively discovering files
                                  in directories. This option can be used
                                  multiple times. Use forward slashes on all
                                  platforms.
  --respect-gitignore / --no-respect-gitignore
                                  Respect .gitignore files when recursively
                                  discovering files in directories. Files passed
                                  directly are not affected by this option.
                                  [default: respect-gitignore]

Execution options:
  --use-pty [yes|no|detect]       Whether to use a pseudo-terminal for running
                                  commands. Using a PTY can be useful for
                                  getting color output from commands, but can
                                  also break in some environments.
                                  
                                  'yes': Always use PTY (not supported on
                                  Windows).
                                  
                                  'no': Never use PTY - useful when doccmd
                                  detects that it is running in a TTY outside of
                                  Windows but the environment does not support
                                  PTYs.
                                  
                                  'detect': Automatically determine based on
                                  environment (default).  [default: DETECT]
  --example-workers INTEGER RANGE
                                  Number of code blocks to evaluate concurrently
                                  within each document when `--no-write-to-file`
                                  is set. Use 0 to auto-detect based on the
                                  number of CPUs. Values greater than 1 are
                                  rejected when writing to files, since doccmd
                                  cannot safely apply changes in parallel. Best
                                  for files with many code blocks. Can be
                                  combined with --document-workers for maximum
                                  parallelism. Output may be interleaved when
                                  using parallel execution.  [default: 1; x>=0]
  --document-workers INTEGER RANGE
                                  Number of documents to evaluate concurrently
                                  when `--no-write-to-file` is set. Use 0 to
                                  auto-detect based on the number of CPUs.
                                  Values greater than 1 are rejected when
                                  writing to files, since doccmd cannot safely
                                  apply changes in parallel. Best for processing
                                  many files. Can be combined with --example-
                                  workers for maximum parallelism. Output may be
                                  interleaved when using parallel execution.

Error handling:
  --fail-on-parse-error / --no-fail-on-parse-error
                                  Whether to fail (with exit code 1) if a given
                                  file cannot be parsed.  [default: no-fail-on-
                                  parse-error]
  --continue-on-error / --no-continue-on-error
                                  Continue executing across all files even when
                                  errors occur. Collects and displays all errors
                                  found, then returns a non-zero exit code if
                                  any command invocation failed. Useful for
                                  seeing all linting errors in large projects.
                                  [default: no-continue-on-error]

Output options:
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose output.

Other options:
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Constraints:
  {--group-marker, --group-file, --group-mdx-by-attribute}
