Usage: doccmd [OPTIONS] [FILE_PATHS]...

  Run commands against code blocks in the given documentation files.

  This works with Markdown and reStructuredText files.

Options:
  -l, --language TEXT             Run `command` against code blocks for this
                                  language.  [required]
  -c, --command TEXT              [required]
  --file-suffix TEXT              The file extension to give to the temporary
                                  file made from the code block. By default, the
                                  file extension is inferred from the language,
                                  or it is '.txt' if the language is not
                                  recognized.
  --file-name-prefix TEXT         The prefix to give to the temporary file made
                                  from the code block. This is useful for
                                  distinguishing files created by this tool from
                                  other files, e.g. for ignoring in linter
                                  configurations.  [default: doccmd; required]
  --lowercase-file-name / --no-lowercase-file-name
                                  Whether to lowercase the name of the temporary
                                  file made from the code block. This is useful
                                  e.g. for Python tools which expect a lowercase
                                  file name.  [default: no-lowercase-file-name]
  --pad-file / --no-pad-file      Run the command against a temporary file
                                  padded with newlines. This is useful for
                                  matching line numbers from the output to the
                                  relevant location in the document. Use --no-
                                  pad-file for formatters - they generally need
                                  to look at the file without padding.
                                  [default: pad-file]
  --version                       Show the version and exit.
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose output.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
