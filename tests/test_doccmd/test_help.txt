Usage: doccmd [OPTIONS] [FILE_PATHS]...

  Run commands against code blocks in the given documentation files.

  This works with Markdown and reStructuredText files.

Options:
  -l, --language TEXT         Run `command` against code blocks for this
                              language.  [required]
  -c, --command TEXT          [required]
  --file-suffix TEXT          The file extension to give to the temporary file
                              made from the code block. By default, the file
                              extension is inferred from the language, or it is
                              '.txt' if the language is not recognized.
  --file-name-prefix TEXT     The prefix to give to the temporary file made from
                              the code block. This is useful for distinguishing
                              files created by this tool from other files, e.g.
                              for ignoring in linter configurations.  [default:
                              doccmd; required]
  --pad-file / --no-pad-file  Run the command against a temporary file padded
                              with newlines. This is useful for matching line
                              numbers from the output to the relevant location
                              in the document. Use --no-pad-file for formatters
                              - they generally need to look at the file without
                              padding.  [default: pad-file]
  --version                   Show the version and exit.
  -v, --verbose               Enable verbose output.
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
